# omr-learning
This repository hosts the training of a deep learning model suitable for Audiveris OMR.

It is based on:
- The YOLO architecture and tools provided by Ultralytics
- The data set provided by Deep Scores V2
- Perhaps other data sets (such as those provided by Audiveris sampling)
- The use of ONNX format between YOLO (Python) and DeepLearning4j (Java)
